    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a shallow mixing bowl, add flour, salt, sugar (if using) and butter
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub together till all turn to crumbs
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 100 ml of water and mix till all is combined. If the dough still needs water add a tablespoon of water at a time till you get well combined dough like in pix5
      </li>
      <li>
        Set dough aside in a cool place or a fridge for 30 minutes then you move on to preparing the meaty filling.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pie Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a pan on medium heat and add oil, heat for 2 minutes, add chopped onions and fry till onion is translucent. Add mince to the onion and stir mince till its brown then add curry powder, thyme, stock cube, a pinch of salt and stir till all combine. Reduce the heat if need be to avoid burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fat from the mince should make the sauce juicy but if it looks dry, add a cooking spoon (100ml) of water to it. (decant oil if it is too much)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add boiled potatoes and carrots, combine well and cook on a low heat for another 3-5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The mince should be well cooked now. Now you move on to thickening the mince.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2tbsp of flour to a bowl and mix with water to form a paste. Add the paste to the mince meat on the heat and combine well. Leave to cook for another minute. Take off the heat and allow to cool.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Meat Pie:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven at 180C/350F
      </li>
      <li>
        Break the egg into a bowl, whisk and set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle a bit of flour on a plain, clean surface/worktop
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 2 or 3 places and roll out flat using a rolling pin
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a circle cutter on the flat dough and cut out into many circles you can get. use a makeshift if you don’t have a cutter. Repeat this process with the rest of the dough
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the meat filling to the centre of the circled dough, brush one half of the circle with whisked egg and carefully fold over the meat filling making sure the 2 edges touch one another. The aim of the egg is to seal the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close edges by pressing down with the tip of a fork
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat this process for the remaining dough and filling. Place a foil in a baking tray and rub with oil this stops the pie from sticking to the tray when done. Alternatively use a parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        After you have completely filled the pastry, set on a baking tray, egg wash the top and pinch with a fork
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes at 180C⁰/350F
      </li>
    </ol>
