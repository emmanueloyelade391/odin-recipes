    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Okra soup is a flavorful dish made with okra, a vegetable also known as "lady's fingers." It's popular in many cuisines, especially in West Africa, the Caribbean, the Southern United States, and parts of the Middle East and India. The soup is known for its slightly slimy texture, which helps thicken the dish naturally.
